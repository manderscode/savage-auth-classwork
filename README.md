# 21 Savage Site - Server Side

This project is a simple CRUD app and it is modeled after a simple social media site. A user can write a message which will then be uploaded to the messages section of the page. Then other users can choose to like or dislike a message and the number of likes or dislikes will increase or decrease accordingly. Any message can be deleted by clicking on the trash can icon.
